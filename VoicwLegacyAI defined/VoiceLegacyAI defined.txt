Voice Legacy AI
Preserve voices. Build legacies. Remember—together.
What it is (in one breath)

Voice Legacy AI is a real-time, hands-free conversation platform that lets you build, train, and speak with living “Personas” based on real voices and memories. You can ingest recordings, transcribe life stories, shape traits and style, and then have natural, continuous conversations—where the persona responds in their own voice, grounded by your shared history and sensitive to your emotions.

Why it exists (the heart)

Everyone has stories that shouldn’t fade: a parent’s laugh, a grandparent’s advice, a partner’s inside jokes, a friend’s wisdom. Photos keep faces; text keeps facts. But voice keeps the person. Voice Legacy AI was born from a simple truth—memories become more meaningful when you can hear them, talk with them, and feel them again.

We paired cutting-edge speech tech with an emotion engine and memory retrieval so the experience isn’t just a talking archive—it’s a conversation that evolves, remembers, and cares. The core promise: build a legacy you can actually talk to.
What it does (feature tour)
   1) Real-time, hands-free conversations

Continuous VAD (voice activity detection) means you click once and speak naturally. No push-to-talk. The app detects pauses and turns automatically.

WebSocket streaming keeps latency low and the conversation flowing.
  
  2) Personas you can shape

Persona traits (e.g., “gentle, humorous, practical”) inform tone, pacing, empathy, and content.

Voice cloning (e.g., ElevenLabs) from clean samples makes replies come back in the persona’s voice.

Style adapters tune delivery (calm vs. energetic) so it sounds right for the moment.

  3) Memory-aware answers (RAG)

Your conversations and uploaded transcripts become searchable memories.

When you ask something, the system pulls relevant snippets to ground replies in what really happened—fishing trip 2004, their recipe, that bit of advice.

You can pin snippets in the UI for emphasis while the back end automatically retrieves what’s relevant.

  4) Ingestion that scales

Upload audio or video. We transcribe, index, detect emotions, and tag memories.

Works with Chroma/Pinecone vector stores (or an in-memory fallback for quick starts).

  5) Emotion-aware interactions

The emotion engine reads sentiment from your words.

TTS delivery adapts to the moment—more stable and warm when you’re hurting, more animated when you’re excited.

  6) Analytics & insights

Persona-level stats: interaction counts, recent activity, common emotional tones.

Over time, you see trends—what themes keep coming up, when conversations are happening, how the tone shifts.

 7) Historical personas (Museum Mode)

Curated figures (e.g., Marie Curie, Lincoln) stay in character, respect historical bounds, and speak in approachable first-person.

Ideal for exhibits, tours, and AR/VR layers over places and artifacts.

 8) Privacy, safety, and control

JWT auth and per-user isolation in search.

You choose what to store. Export, delete, or reseed personas and memories at any time.

Works locally and scales to cloud—your infrastructure, your rules.

 9) Developer-friendly

FastAPI back end, Next.js front end, and Docker/compose files for one-command runs.

Clear routes for auth, personas, memories, ingest, voice training, analytics, and real-time voice.

Why it’s different (what the market doesn’t have)

Not just a chatbot: It listens to your voice, answers back in voice, and stays consistent with who you trained it to be.

Hands-free by design: Most competitors still require push-to-talk or awkward turn-taking.

Grounded in your history: Memory retrieval keeps it real—less hallucination, more “us.”

Emotion-aware delivery: We don’t just say the right thing; we try to say it the right way.

Built for both consumers and institutions: Family legacies and museum tours. Personal grief work and classroom enrichment.

  11) The Avatar Creation Suite 

This is where Voice Legacy AI becomes visual. When you build or train a persona, you can optionally add a face and body—either by uploading a photo, a short video, or selecting a base model from within the app.

MetaHuman integration provides cinema-grade realism: fine muscle movement, blinking, breathing, and micro-expressions that correspond to speech.

SadTalker and Ready Player Me adapters ensure flexibility—MetaHuman for realism, Ready Player Me for lightweight AR/VR performance.

The avatar syncs perfectly with the AI’s voice in real time, delivering lip-sync precision down to the phoneme and matching emotional tone.

Emotional alignment: When the persona speaks softly, the face softens; when recalling joy, it smiles; when comforting, it leans in slightly—all automatically.

The result?
You don’t just hear your loved one, teacher, or historical figure—you see them. The expression, the posture, the spark in their eyes. That’s what transforms remembrance into living legacy.

Avatars can be displayed in:

AR (Augmented Reality) – Place your mother’s or mentor’s avatar right beside you on your couch using your phone or headset.

VR or desktop environments – Walk through interactive memory spaces where avatars speak to you naturally.

Museum installations or kiosks – Project life-sized, interactive figures in full fidelity, able to respond to questions in real time.

Example deployments (vivid scenarios)

  Smithsonian Hall: A kid asks, “What scared you about early X-ray work?” Marie Curie answers softly, mentions specific lab practices, and encourages curiosity—with a short audio clip of an archival quote embedded in the response.

  Gettysburg Battlefield: At Little Round Top, a persona of a Union soldier describes the terrain and tactics, then asks the visitor, “Do you know why this hill mattered?”—turning visitors into participants.

  Disney Queue: A character kiosk cracks a new joke when the decibel meter hears laughter; VAD enables crisp 15-second back-and-forths that keep the line entertained.

  Memory Care Center: Evenings offer a gentle “goodnight routine” in a loved one’s voice with reassuring phrases remembered from decades of family life.

  High School History: Students “interview” historical figures about primary sources; the app refuses anachronisms and points students back to documents stored as memories.

  Bonus markets unlocked by avatar technology
Entertainment & media production

Virtual hosts for podcasts, YouTube, or VR concerts.

Posthumous performances for artists, with family consent and ethical watermarking.

Corporate knowledge & training

Founders or experts recorded once can mentor future teams as interactive avatars.

Internal knowledge base accessible through “AI colleagues” that look and sound like the original trainers.

Example deployments (with AR)

  Smithsonian Hall: A lifelike MetaHuman Marie Curie avatar greets visitors, making eye contact, reacting subtly to questions, her lab coat shimmering under virtual light.

Until now, avatars have been novelty or spectacle. Voice Legacy AI turns them into living memory—a fusion of realism, empathy, and continuity.
We already have the working engine: memory recall, emotional tone, real-time speech. Adding faces through MetaHuman brings the soul into focus.

This is not science fiction—it’s remembrance, redefined.


Closing

Voice Legacy AI is more than another AI app. It’s a promise that the voices that shape us—their warmth, humor, and wisdom—won’t go silent. We’ve built the rails for that legacy: real-time conversations, memory-aware grounding, emotion-sensitive delivery, and beautiful experiences across homes, museums, parks, classrooms, and care facilities.Voice Legacy AI captures what it means to be human—our sound, our stories, and now our face.
It allows families, institutions, and nations to preserve legacies that speak and live again.
Hearing your father’s voice is powerful. Seeing him smile as he speaks—seeing his eyes react to yours—that’s legacy.

We built this not just to remember, but to continue the conversation.
And with lifelike avatars through MetaHuman and AR integration, that conversation now happens face-to-face, heart-to-heart, across generations.
